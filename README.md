Messing around with some microlensing codes

This software is not mine and is not licensed.
According to the creator
>VBBinaryLensing (or VBBL for short) is a C++ contour integration code for binary microlensing developed by Valerio Bozza. The algorithms behind this code are described in MNRAS 408 (2010) 2188. Please cite this paper if you make any scientific use of this code.```
